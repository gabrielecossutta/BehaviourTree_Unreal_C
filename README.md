Unreal Project, Implementation of behaviorTree and BlackBoard in c++

I created a simple mini tag game where four balls are positioned randomly. The AI must take one of the balls (the nearest ball) and run toward the player to win. However, if the player has one of the four balls and touches the AI, the player wins.

The focus of this project is not the game itself but the custom behavior node, behaviour service and blackboard that i implemented in C++.
